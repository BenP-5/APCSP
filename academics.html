    		This year I worked to get into Honors society and to have good grades for college applications. My classes were IM3, APCSP, Spanish 3 in Action, Physics, English 5-6, and US History. Of these, my hardest class was US History just because of the amount of work we were assigned. My favorite class was APCSP because it was pretty chill and I found the work easy.
